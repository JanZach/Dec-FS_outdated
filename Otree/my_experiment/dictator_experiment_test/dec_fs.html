        In addition to the before mentioned AI-based prediction, we will generate a second prediction about your payment decision. However, for the second prediction, you may decide which of your attributes are used by the Artificial Intelligence model.

    <p>

        Please decide which of your attributes are submitted to the AI model for the payment prediction:

    <p>

        {{ if player.treatment == 1 }}
        <strong> Be aware that the algorithm tracks your decisions.
            In other words: The fact that you wish to withhold certain features may affect the AI model's prediction about you. </strong>
        {{ else }}
        {{ endif }}
